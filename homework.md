## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

You download the repository from GitHub to your local computer so you can work on it offline.


## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is when you ask to merge changes you’ve made in your copy of a repository back into the original project. It’s how you suggest improvements or fixes.
